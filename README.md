# TF2 decal tool patcher

## Summary

A patcher for TF2 Windows client which removes the restrictions regarding full-colored decals. Now you can apply full-colored images not only to your Objectors and Flairs, but to Photo Badge and Clan Pride too!


## Deployment

Either grab the binary file (*patcher.exe*) or compile it from source code (*patcher.dpr*). Please note that anything never than Delphi 2009 will fail to compile this code because of unicode string mappings, I'll fix it soon.
You can use FPC (>=2.x) if you wish.


## How to use

*DO NOT CONNECT TO A VAC-SECURED SERVER WHILE DOING THIS STUFF!*
You should have a Decal Tool, a decalable item, and the image you wish to apply to this item. Image must be in 128x128 resolution. PNG format is preferred.
Launch the game. After your main menu gets loaded, launch *patcher.exe*. Enter the path for your image (e.g. *C:\pootis.png*) and press Enter.
See if everything is okay (a "Successful!" message should appear in patcher console). After that, you can close the patcher.
Open your backpack, navigate to your Decal Tool and use it on a decalable item. There will be a choice to either use your avatar or a custom image; does not matter what you choose. Click "Next". If everything is correct, you will see your full-colored decal in the preview image!
Apply the decal. Close the game and fire it up again. You can connect to servers now - the item will stay in your inventory forever.
